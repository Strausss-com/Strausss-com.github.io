## OUTSIDE
### Bakeries
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dwKWFyRkyNgDro3L8">"Au levain d'antan"</a> Literally across the street, 2 minutes there and back from the dining table  - closed evenings & weekends
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/VZDZRajVvA6nuXpLA">"Alexine"</a> Up the road, often a queue, has bread later in the evening than previous, better croissants  worth the walk  
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dwKWFyRkyNgDro3L8">"Pain Pain"</a> next door if the others are closed. Pro tip: If you are only getting baguette, you can skip the queuen by going in the left hand door. SOmewhat industrial.
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/yAX6bmhcsxe8NKURA">"Les copains"</a>: Across the street, the pastries look amazing however are overprived and oversugared HOWEVER you can try the single (!) espresso for €2. Single only - it is absolute rocket fuel.
-   
### Groceries
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/UbnZcjmJf6QhYuhZA">"Intermarché Express"</a>: well stocked, convenient, unique layout  AND you don't have to walk down & up the hill
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/UbnZcjmJf6QhYuhZA">Carrefour</a>: slightly larger than above 
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2hcecM8zcEseJqnF8">"Paris Market" minimart</a>: if you need a beer and an apple at 3:30 a.m. and only want to walk 53 meters  
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y4c4xZXNeXFHqfqm9">"Boucherie Jacky Gaudin"</a>: an acceptable butcher, not many left. Please let us know if you find other / better 

### Shops

### Bars & Restaurants
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CFdZf9jUvELVU4e19">"Le petit Café de Montmartre"</a>: Danielle the 80+ year old owner is one of last ones to remember Jack 
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rioQCCRCfmXstcP59">"Chez Clint"</a>: Where we held Jack's wake
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eg4Nc2NNFnGvt5JL9">"La Boîte aux Lettres"</a>: Good restaurant, very solid price/performance. Reservation recommended
- <a href="https://lacouveemontmartre.com/">"La Couvée"</a>: recommended by Kicki & Uli, French not cheap 
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y37Lj1KxFNiwD3Y69">"Chez Celiane"</a>: Chinese takeout, fun buying 2-3 different individual items for a Euro each. Samosas good, the chicken spring roll aint great, vegetable better, have not tried the dishes.
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/47WSBTB9S9x1uFfS7">"Dumbo"</a>: Popular Burger, takeout only
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/gHvvGGH6F5UTXPZS8">"Shinjuku Pigalle"</a>: Slightly hipster Japanese.

- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/i17YN8SQFHo3WnJB6">"Flunch"</a>: ONLY for bankrupt studendts & artists. They have a small salad bowl for 2.95 (not weight), any main dish comes with "Unlimited vegetables" including good fries - a way to get fiber in between all the baguette. With the loyalty card you get a free coffee.
- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/krfM4RSC8DogvmWd9">"Brasserie Lipp"</a>: Far away, classic & not cheap
